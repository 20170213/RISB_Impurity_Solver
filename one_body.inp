#The format is
#
#orbital_label1 orbital_label2 energy
#
#Say, for one-orbital impurity of site energy 0, and mu=1.0, then this file should look like
#
#0 0 -1.0
#1 1 -1.0
#
#the value -1.0=epsilon-mu. We need labels 0 and 1 because of two spins acting like two orbitals instead of one
#
0 0 -1.5
1 1 -1.5
