#The format is
#
#orbital_label1 orbital_label2 orbital_label3 orbital_label4 interaction_strength
#
#Say, we have an orbital where label 0 is spin up and label 1 is spin down, effectively a two-orbital problem
#interaction is H_{int}=U*f^{dagger}_{0}*f_{0}*f^{dagger}_{1}*f_{1}, where we choose U=1.0, then this file should look like
#
#0 0 1 1 0.5
#1 1 0 0 0.5
#
#Where interaction strength is U/2 to not double-count
#
0 0 1 1 1.5
1 1 0 0 1.5
